# Keywords
- All the 50 keywords with usage are listed below.

### 1. abstract Java Keyword
The abstract keyword is used to declare a class or a method as abstract. An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract means it may or may not include abstract methods. 

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.

### 2. assert Java Keyword
Assert describes a predicate (a true-false statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. 

If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort. Optionally enable by ClassLoader method.

### 3. boolean Java Keyword
Defines a boolean variable for the values "true" or "false" only. By default, the value of boolean primitive type is false. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type boolean.

### 4. break Java Keyword
The break keyword is used to prematurely exit a for, while, or do while loop or to mark the end of a case block in a switch statement.

### 5. byte Java Keyword
The byte keyword is used to declare a field that can hold an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type byte.

### 6. case Java Keyword
A statement in the switch block can be labeled with one or more case or default labels. The switch statement evaluates its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching case label.

### 7. catch Java Keyword
Used in conjunction with a try block and an optional finally block. The statements in the catch block specify what to do if a specific type of exception is thrown by the try block.

### 8. char Java Keyword
The char keyword is used to declare character variable. 
char is a Java primitive type. 
In Java, the data type used to store characters is char. The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character.

It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
The Wrapper Character class represents char primitive type as an object.

### 9. class Java Keyword
The class keyword is used to define the classes in Java. A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. In short, a class is the specification or template of an object.

### 10. continue Java Keyword
Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label, continue resumes execution at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body.

The continue statement skips the current iteration of a for, while or do-while loop. The unlabeled form skips to the end of the innermost loop's body and evaluates the boolean expression that controls the loop.
